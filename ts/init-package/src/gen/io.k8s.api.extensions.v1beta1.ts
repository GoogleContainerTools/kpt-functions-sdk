  //   list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a

  //   request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
  //   of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
  //   matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
  // * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
  //   the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
  //   or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
