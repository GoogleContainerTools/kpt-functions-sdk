# KPT Functions

![badge][ci-badge]

KPT Functions are client-side programs that make it easy to operate on a repository of Kubernetes configuration files.

Use cases:

- **Configuration Compliance:** e.g. Require all `Namespace` configurations to have a `cost-center` label.
- **Configuration Generation:** e.g. Provide a blueprint for new services by generating a `Namespace` with organization-mandated defaults for `RBAC`, `ResourceQuota`, etc.
- **Configuration Migration:** e.g. Update all `PodSecurityPolicy` configurations to improve the
security posture.

KPT functions can be run as one-off functions or as part of a CI/CD pipeline.

In GitOps workflows, KPT functions read and write configuration files from a Git repo. Changes
to the system authored by humans and mutating KPT functions are reviewed before being committed to the repo. KPT functions
can be run as pre-commit or post-commit steps to check for compliance before configurations are
applied to a cluster.

## FAQ

### Why KPT Functions

- **Configuration is data:** Many configuration tools conflate data with the operations on that
  data (e.g. YAML files embedding a templating language).
  As configuration becomes complex, it becomes hard to read and understand.
  Our design philosophy is to separate *human-readable data* from the *state-less programs* that
  manipulate that data. We call these programs *functions*.
- **Unix philosophy:** Functions should be small, reusable, and composable.
  By implementing the [Configuration Functions Specification][spec],
  we can develop an ever-growing catalog of useful, interoperable functions.

### Why a Typescript SDK

We provide an opinionated Typescript SDK for implementing KPT Functions. This provides various
advantages:

- **General-purpose language:** Domain-Specific Languages begin their life with a reasonable
  feature set, but often grow over time. They bloat in order to accommodate the tremendous variety
  of customer use cases. Rather than follow this same course, KPT functions employ a true,
  general-purpose programming language that provides:
  - Proper abstractions and language features
  - A extensive ecosystem of tooling (e.g. IDE support)
  - A comprehensive catalog of well-supported libraries
  - Robust community support and detailed documentation
- **Type-safety:** Kubernetes configuration is typed, and its schema is defined using the OpenAPI spec.
  Typescript has a sophisticated type system that accommodates the complexity of Kubernetes resources.
  The SDK enables generating Typescript classes for core and CRD types, providing safe and easy
  interaction with Kubernetes objects.
- **Batteries-included:** The SDK provides a simple, powerful API for querying and manipulating configuration
  files. It provides the scaffolding required to develop, build, test, and publish functions,
  allowing you to focus on implementing your business-logic.
